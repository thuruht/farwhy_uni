# Implementation Plan

Based on our review of the codebase and documentation, here are the next steps to fix the remaining ## Priority Order for Implementation

1. ✅ Fix API response handling (highest priority) - COMPLETED
2. ✅ Fix blog form duplicate modal activation - COMPLETED
3. ✅ Implement auto-population for event creation (Aaron's requirement) - COMPLETED
4. Fix stats display if still an issue
5. Implement form validation
6. Verify security implementation
7. Clean up code
8. Enhance UI# 1. API Response Handling Fix

The primary issue appears to be that the `api.post()` and `api.put()` methods don't parse JSON responses:

### Current implementation:
```javascript
post: async function(endpoint, data) {
    return await this._call(endpoint, {
        method: 'POST',
        headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
        body: JSON.stringify(data)
    });
}
```

### Fix to implement:
```javascript
post: async function(endpoint, data) {
    const res = await this._call(endpoint, {
        method: 'POST',
        headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
        body: JSON.stringify(data)
    });
    if (res) return await res.json();
    return null;
}
```

Apply the same fix to the `put` method. This should resolve the main issue with form submissions.

## 2. Blog Form Duplicate Modal Activation

In the `showBlogForm()` function, there's a duplicate call to `modal.classList.add('active')`:

### Current implementation:
```javascript
// Line ~674
modal.classList.add('active');
// ...form setup...
// Line ~693
modal.classList.add('active');
```

### Fix to implement:
Remove the second call since it's redundant and could potentially cause issues.

## 3. Stats Display Fix

The dashboard stats are showing 0 for events and blog posts despite data existing in the database. This could be related to:

1. The API endpoint not returning the correct data
2. The `loadStats()` function not properly parsing the response
3. The DOM update not correctly displaying the data

We'll need to debug this by:
1. Adding console logs to check the API response
2. Verifying the data structure returned by the API
3. Ensuring the DOM is updated correctly
**note: this "0" display only happens when we do things like run local server,
 or (re)introduce one of various minor bugs into the code; seems ok right now

## 4. Auto-Population for Event Creation

From the PRIORITY_GOALS.txt file, we need to implement:

> "Event creation requests: Auto-populate 'All ages' when Howdy is selected and '21+ unless with parent or legal guardian' when Farewell is selected. Auto-populate 'Doors at 7pm / Music at 8pm' for the time section (but allow to be edited if needed)."

This functionality is defined in the database schema but needs to be implemented in the frontend:

```javascript
// Add venue change handler to the event form
document.querySelector('select[name="venue"]').addEventListener('change', (e) => {
    const venue = e.target.value;
    if (venue === 'farewell') {
        document.querySelector('input[name="age_restriction"]').value = '21+ unless with parent or legal guardian';
    } else if (venue === 'howdy') {
        document.querySelector('input[name="age_restriction"]').value = 'All ages';
    }
    
    // Set default time regardless of venue
    if (!document.querySelector('input[name="event_time"]').value) {
        document.querySelector('input[name="event_time"]').value = 'Doors at 7pm / Music at 8pm';
    }
});
```

## 5. Form Validation Enhancement

Add client-side form validation for required fields before submission:

1. Implement form validation for the event form
2. Implement form validation for the blog form
3. Display validation errors to users in a friendly way

## 6. Security Enhancement

Based on the SECURITY.md document, we should ensure the login system is using:

1. HTTP-only cookies for the session token
2. Proper JWT validation
3. Session expiration handling

The security system appears to be well-designed with both JWT and KV session fallback, but we should verify it's properly implemented.

## 7. Code Cleanup

After fixing the core issues:

1. Remove unnecessary console.logs
2. Optimize event handling
3. Add documentation comments to complex code sections

## 8. UI Enhancements

1. Add loading indicators during form submissions
2. Improve error message display
3. Add confirmation dialogs for delete actions

## Priority Order for Implementation

1. Fix API response handling (highest priority)
2. Fix blog form duplicate modal activation
3. Implement auto-population for event creation (Aaron's requirement)
4. Fix stats display
5. Implement form validation
6. Verify security implementation
7. Clean up code
8. Enhance UI

## Future Features (from PRIORITY_GOALS.txt)

Once the immediate fixes are complete, these features should be considered:

1. Make YouTube video/featured section on the front page a carousel for multiple videos
2. Make the drinks menu popup editable from the dashboard
3. Create an image gallery for notable shows
4. Build a show history/archive page with ample storage
5. Update the "hours" section with editable text for both venues
6. Add links to the Howdy DIY Thrift Instagram and website
7. Consider a webstore for merchandise
