Fix: Update calendar div and events handling in public index

This commit fixes issues with the calendar div in public/index.html and updates
event handling in ifrevl.js:

1. Fixed calendar image click behavior:
   - Added events-modal-trigger class to the calendar image
   - Added cursor:pointer style to make it clear the image is clickable
   - Made it directly trigger the events modal rather than an old popup

2. Updated ifrevl.js to:
   - Replace open-popup class with events-modal-trigger
   - Update link handling to use javascript:void(0) instead of URLs
   - Add backward compatibility for any remaining open-popup links
   - Redirect old popup links to trigger the new events modal

3. Improved event text:
   - Removed outdated text about different venue views showing different listings
   - Updated to indicate events from both venues are shown in the modal

4. Improved code integration between:
   - ifrevl.js (legacy script)
   - events-modal.js (new modal functionality)
   - index.html (main public page)

These changes ensure a consistent user experience by making all event-related
links and the calendar image open the new events modal instead of popup windows.
