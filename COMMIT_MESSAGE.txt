Fix: Implemented missing navigation functions in admin dashboard

This commit resolves the "showSection is not defined" error in the admin dashboard by:

1. Adding the missing `showSection` function to admin-unified.js
   - Implemented proper section switching and display
   - Added CSS class toggling for active sections
   - Connected to section-specific data loading functions

2. Adding complementary missing functions:
   - `loadVenueSettings`: Added placeholder for venue settings display
   - `setupImportHandlers`: Implemented legacy event import functionality

3. Updated documentation:
   - Added section navigation details to DOCUMENTATION.md
   - Updated PROGRESS_REPORT.md with completed fixes

This change ensures proper navigation between dashboard sections, fixes the runtime error, and maintains consistent state tracking in the dashboard.
