Fix: Public page links and admin table layout

This commit includes several important fixes:

1. Fixed "view show listings" link in public/index.html to:
   - Only open the events modal and not an empty popup window
   - Use javascript:void(0) to prevent default link behavior
   - Renamed trigger class from "open-popup" to "events-modal-trigger" for clarity

2. Updated text in the calendar section:
   - Removed outdated text about different venue views showing different listings
   - Replaced with simpler message about viewing events at both venues
   - Improved the styling with a lighter background

3. Updated events-modal.js to use the new trigger class

4. Fixed misaligned table headers in event management section
   - Properly structured the table HTML with consistent column widths
   - Added proper vertical alignment for all cells
   - Ensured image thumbnails are properly aligned and sized

5. Applied consistent styling to tables for uniform appearance
   - Added identical styling for thumbnails across tables
   - Maintained consistent vertical alignment across all tables

6. Updated documentation in PROGRESS_REPORT.md

These changes ensure a better user experience with both the public site events modal
and the admin dashboard tables, providing a more professional and usable interface.
