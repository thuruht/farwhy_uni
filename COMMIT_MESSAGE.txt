Fix Flyer Upload URL in Event Form

This commit resolves an issue with the flyer upload functionality in the admin dashboard:

1. Fixed issue where uploaded flyer URLs weren't properly populated in the form:
   - The backend was returning relative URLs (`/images/flyers/filename.jpg`) but the frontend wasn't handling them correctly
   - Added code to convert relative URLs to full URLs with proper origin
   - Added better console logging to debug the upload response
   - Ensured the URL is correctly formatted before setting it in the form field

Now when uploading event flyers:
- The URL is properly converted to a full URL if needed
- The flyer image URL field is correctly populated
- The user can see the actual URL that will be used for the event

4. Mobile responsiveness improvements
   - Optimized filter controls for mobile screens
   - Enhanced event details layout for smaller devices
   - Improved touch targets and readability on mobile

5. Backend API updates
   - Modified event handlers to remove default placeholder text
   - Updated normalizeEventForDisplay and getSlideshow functions

6. Events Modal UI Polishing (Part 2)
   - Made "Upcoming Only" the default when opening the modal
   - Standardized all filter buttons (Both Venues, Upcoming Only, Howdy, Farewell) to have the same size
   - Fixed event details view with flyer that wasn't displaying correctly
   - Added error handling for event images that fail to load
   - Enhanced responsive layout for all event details components
   - Improved contrast and readability of event information

7. Filter UX Improvement
   - Added check marks (âœ“) to clearly indicate active filter buttons
   - Updated venue button text to be more descriptive ("FAREWELL ONLY", "HOWDY ONLY")
   - Standardized button sizes with fixed height and minimum width
   - Improved consistency of button text length for better visual alignment
   - Made buttons the same size on both desktop and mobile (adjusted proportionally)

8. Documentation updates
   - Updated PROGRESS_REPORT.md with the latest improvements
   - Added detailed documentation of changes and features

These changes make the events modal more intuitive and informative, providing users
with a better experience when viewing event listings across both venues.
