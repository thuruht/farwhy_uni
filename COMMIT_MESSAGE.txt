Fix Modal Venue Selection and Calendar Links

This commit resolves two critical issues with the events modal:

1. Fixed issue where credEt div links stop working when switched to "howdy" state:
   - Added direct event listeners to newly created calendar overlay links
   - Implemented event delegation for all events-modal-trigger links
   - Created a custom event system for communication between ifrevl.js and events-modal.js

2. Fixed issue where modal still shows "Farewell only" instead of "Howdy only" when opened from howdy state:
   - Added a MutationObserver to detect and respond to data-state changes
   - Ensured currentVenue is updated from body data-state immediately before opening modal
   - Added logging to track venue state changes for easier debugging
   - Updated openModal function to correctly set active tab based on current state

These changes ensure:
- All modal trigger links work consistently regardless of current data-state
- The modal defaults to the correct venue filter (farewell/howdy) based on current page state
- Calendar links in both states trigger the modal with proper venue selection
- Event listeners are properly attached even when links are dynamically recreated

4. Mobile responsiveness improvements
   - Optimized filter controls for mobile screens
   - Enhanced event details layout for smaller devices
   - Improved touch targets and readability on mobile

5. Backend API updates
   - Modified event handlers to remove default placeholder text
   - Updated normalizeEventForDisplay and getSlideshow functions

6. Events Modal UI Polishing (Part 2)
   - Made "Upcoming Only" the default when opening the modal
   - Standardized all filter buttons (Both Venues, Upcoming Only, Howdy, Farewell) to have the same size
   - Fixed event details view with flyer that wasn't displaying correctly
   - Added error handling for event images that fail to load
   - Enhanced responsive layout for all event details components
   - Improved contrast and readability of event information

7. Filter UX Improvement
   - Added check marks (âœ“) to clearly indicate active filter buttons
   - Updated venue button text to be more descriptive ("FAREWELL ONLY", "HOWDY ONLY")
   - Standardized button sizes with fixed height and minimum width
   - Improved consistency of button text length for better visual alignment
   - Made buttons the same size on both desktop and mobile (adjusted proportionally)

8. Documentation updates
   - Updated PROGRESS_REPORT.md with the latest improvements
   - Added detailed documentation of changes and features

These changes make the events modal more intuitive and informative, providing users
with a better experience when viewing event listings across both venues.
